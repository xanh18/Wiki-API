# Wiki-API
 I created a RESTFUL Wiki-API to demonstrate that I can create an resful API. In this API I can add and delete information I want to.

What have I Learned ?

- Learned about restful routing. 

- Learned about dynamic routing from express with node.js through HTTPS

- Learned how to use mongoDB with mongoose

- Learned how to use postman, to make the calls to mongo DB with GET,POST,PUT,PATCH,DELETE

- Learned how to work with NPM PACKAGES like body-parser, nodemon and express
